# Math-Tutor

Description:

My task was to create a GUI‐based Java application that would help an elementary
school student learn the mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication. 

* The program begins by generating a random integer in the range 1 through 3, inclusive, to randomly select
one of the three operations. 

* Next, it generates two random integers in the range 1 through 10, inclusive, for the operands. 
Finally, it displays a math problem of the chosen type. 

* After displaying the problem, the program prompts the student to enter his or her answer. 

* If the student answers incorrectly, the program displays the message “I'm sorry, but no. Please try again”. 

* If the student answers correctly, the program displays the message “Very good!”, along with the number of attempts
to solve the problem. 

* Regardless of whether the student’s response was correct or incorrect, the
program provides him or her with the opportunity to solve additional problems by clicking on a “New
Problem” button.
